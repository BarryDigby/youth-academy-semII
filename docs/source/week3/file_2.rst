Worksheet
=========

I have prepared an ``Rmd`` file containing code to load a dataset with questions for you to answer. 

The ``Rmd`` file is located at: `the following link <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BarryDigby/youth-academy-semII/master/docs/source/worksheets/week3.Rmd>`_

Like last week, create a new R Markdown document on RStudio Cloud and paste the code from the ``Rmd`` file into the document.
